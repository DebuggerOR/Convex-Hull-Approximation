# Convex-Hull-Approximation
This was my senior project in developing and visualizing a quick convex hull approximation. 

* Abstract: This paper dives in to an algorithm for fast convex hulls. The paper introduces the subject of convex hulls and then implements Professors Calder and Oberman's algorithm. It will go into detail of using half-spaces to collect points as you push an amount $h$ into the point cloud. The algorithm would then calculate the half-spaces that collected the most points and assign those as the sides of the convex hull. It will show how to implement all of this using Matlab. The objective of this algorithm is to give a optimal runtime of finding a convex hull.
